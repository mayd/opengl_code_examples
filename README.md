## OpenGL Code Samples

The code in this repository is taken from [OpenGL Code Samples](https://www.opengl.org/archives/resources/code/samples/simple/)
and modified to build and run on Windows 10 with MSYS2/MINGW.

Downloaded and extracted the following examples from [https://www.opengl.org/archives/resources/code/samples/simple.zip](https://www.opengl.org/archives/resources/code/samples/simple.zip):

* `accum.c` Simple program to test accumulation.
* `bitmap1.c` Simple program to test bitmap rendering.
* `bitmap2.c` Simple program to test bitmap rendering.
* `copy.c` Program that demonstrates reading back the framebuffer and zooming the pixels.
* `depth.c` Simple program to test depth buffering.
* `logo.c` Not so simple test that does all sorts of stuff (see the source for more details).
* `nurb.c` Simple nurb (non-uniform rational b-spline) program.
* `packedpix.c` Program that uses packed pixel types for DrawPixels, ReadPixels, TexImage2D, and GetTexImage. Use -h option to display a list of command line options. Use Key h in the created window for key options.
* `prim.c` All the OpenGL primitives all in a row.
* `quad.c` Another "megatest" with lots of options.
* `sphere.c` Test of auto texture coordinate generation.
* `stretch.c` Neat little warping program. Click in the window to add control points, and press space bar to start warping.
* `teapot.c` Ye 'ole classic (red in this case) teapot.
* `twotextures.c` Simple example of using two textures.
* `wave.c` Neat wave program with some contouring options (press 'c').
